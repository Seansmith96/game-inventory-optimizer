Game Inventory Optimization (Knapsack Problem in Python)

Overview:
This project simulates an inventory optimization system for a fictional video game(Or possibly, my future game). It applies linear programming to help players maximize the total value of items they can carry, given a weight limit. The script demonstrates the use of binary decision variables, constraints, and objective functions using Python and PuLP.

Tools Used:
Python (pandas, pulp)

CSV for item input

Terminal for output

Project Workflow:
1. Item Input:
A CSV file (items.csv) contains the inventory data with item names, weights, and in-game values.

2. Optimization Script:
A Python script (inventory_optimizer.py) reads the CSV, formulates a 0/1 knapsack problem using PuLP, and solves it to find the optimal item combination.

Key functionality includes:

Binary decision variables: 1 if the item is selected, 0 if not

Objective: Maximize total value of selected items

Constraint: Total weight must not exceed the players capacity (default is 10)

3. Output:
After solving the model, the script prints:

Optimization status (Optimal)

List of selected items to include in the inventory

Business Relevance:
This project mimics decision-making under constraints common in game development and inventory systems. It provides a foundation for more advanced systems such as:

Multi-constraint loadouts (e.g., space + weight)

Value-per-weight optimization

Real-time loot filtering

Integration with in-game economy balancing tools

Future Enhancements:
Add an interface for players to upload items and view optimized loadouts

Support for multiple constraints (e.g., cost, rarity, slot size)

Dynamic weight limits based on character level or perks

I do these projects with gaming related data as its a hobby of mine. BUT the logic here can be used in Data Science/Business Solutions projects AND its nice because I can utilize it for my game that I am developing.
